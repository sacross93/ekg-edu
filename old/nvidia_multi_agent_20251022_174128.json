Speaking in an interview with Citadel Securities, Huang questioned the wisdom of policies that cost America one of the world's largest markets.\n\nThe Biden Administration imposed rules in 2022 to restrict exports of Nvidia's most advanced AI chips to China. The Trump Administration blocked additional chip sales in April and later granted export licenses for certain Nvidia and AMD chips in exchange for 15% of revenues. Chinese regulators responded by telling domestic tech companies to avoid Nvidia chips designed to meet U.S. export requirements. Beijing also placed strict limits on exports of rare earths. Huang noted that about half the world's AI researchers are in China and called it a mistake not to have them build AI on American technology.\n\n←\nRelated Links\n→\nGoogle To Let 'Superfans' Test In-Development Pixel Phones\nNvidia and AMD To Pay 15% of China Chip Sale Revenues To US Government\nChina Tells Its Tech Companies To Stop Buying All of Nvidia's AI Chips\nLouvre Museum Security 'Outdated and Inadequate' at Time of Heist"

The analyst revised his data center estimates to $351 billion, which is 36% higher than consensus estimates. Lee believes that a recovery in China could also provide a tailwind.\n\n“We also see potential easing of China GPU uncertainties following the potential US-China trade deal that could enable NVIDIA to see a demand recovery in the Chinese market,” the analyst wrote. “With c78% upside, we upgrade our rating to Buy as we expect AI GPU TAM to keep increasing beyond hyperscalers, leading to continuous earnings growth.”\n\nAnalysts at the firm raised Nvidia’s fiscal 2027 estimate for Chip on Wafer on Substrate, or CoWoS, allocation to 700K (from 480K). This marks the first significant rebound in CoWoS wafer allocation momentum since the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nThey noted that Nvidia’s aggressive fiscal 2027 estimate for CoWoS wafer forecasts at TSM will trigger an upward revision in fiscal 2027 datacenter revenues and reinforce their view of a rapidly expanding AI GPU market.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in AI-driven solutions, offering platforms for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, and cloud services.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Here’s how it works.\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nMicron is reportedly preparing to halt sales of server memory chips to data centers in mainland China, after its business there failed to recover from a 2023 cybersecurity ban. The move, reported by Reuters citing unnamed internal sources, has not been confirmed by Micron, but would mark a significant retrenchment from the world’s fastest-growing data center market.\n\nAccording to the report, citing people familiar with the matter, Micron intends to cease shipments of its DRAM and other server-grade memory products to Chinese data centers, while continuing to supply the country’s automotive and smartphone sectors. The company would also continue to serve certain Chinese clients that operate data centers abroad, including Lenovo, the sources said. Micron declined to comment on the rumors but did acknowledge that the 2023 ban had impacted the division and that it “abides by applicable regulations where it does business.”\n\nIf true, the decision would highlight how little ground Micron has regained since Beijing’s 2023 ban on its products in “critical information infrastructure” — a policy the Cyberspace Administration of China justified on national security grounds. The ban effectively locked Micron out of many state-backed data center projects, forcing domestic and Korean suppliers to fill the void. At the time, the ruling was widely seen as a countermeasure against US export restrictions on advanced chips.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM TOM'S HARDWARE\nYOU MAY LIKE\nYMTC and CXMT team up to accelerate Chinese domestic HBM production\nChinese memory maker reportedly preparing for $42 billion IPO\nChina mandates domestic firms source 50% of chips from Chinese producers\n\nIf the reports are true, Micron’s withdrawal from China’s data-center segment may allow Samsung and SK Hynix to further solidify their position in the Chinese server DRAM market, but recent US restrictions could make that difficult. Local players such as YMTC and CXMT have also expanded production under Beijing’s push for semiconductor self-sufficiency, though their technologies still lag in performance and yield. China’s data center investment linked to artificial intelligence surged to roughly 24.7 billion yuan ($3.4 billion) last year, according to Reuters.\n\nMainland China accounted for around 12% of Micron’s revenue last fiscal year, and most of its recent growth has come from AI infrastructure demand elsewhere.

The GARP approach helps identify stocks priced below the market or any suitable target determined by a fundamental analysis.\n\nThe strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks with impressive prospects and trading at a discount. GARP stocks have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and other metrics.\n\nA portfolio based on the GARP strategy comprises stocks that offer the best value and growth investment. Stryker SYK, NVIDIA NVDA, ResMed RMD and Ralph Lauren RL are some promising GARP stocks.\n\nGARP Metrics: Mix of Growth & Value Metrics\n\nThe GARP strategy offers ideal investment options, utilizing the best value and growth investing features. Investors adopting the GARP approach prefer stocks priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. The stocks have solid prospects based on cash flow, revenues, EPS, etc.\n\nGrowth Metrics\n\nA strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the primary concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a tactic of GARP investors. The GARP strategy considers growth rates between 10% and 20% ideal.\n\nAnother metric considered by growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE than the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with a positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.\n\nValue Metrics\n\nGARP investing prioritizes one of the popular value metrics, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. The investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios than value investors, but it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. The price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is also taken into consideration.\n\nUsing the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.\n\nScreening Parameters\n\nAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. \n\nLast five-year EPS & projected 3-5-year EPS growth rates between 10% and 25% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)\n\nROE (in the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE than the industry average indicates superior stocks.)\n\nP/E and P/B ratios are less than the M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued.)\n\nHere are four out of the 12 stocks that made it through the screen.  Each of the four stocks carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nStryker’s inter"

Cisco’s aggressive AI push and growing security dominance are driving prospects.  \n\nAI Infrastructure orders from webscale customers hit $2 billion in fiscal 2025, double the management’s original expectation. However, slowing momentum in networking revenues and a challenging macroeconomic environment have been impacting share price movement. In fiscal 2025, networking revenues declined 3% from 2024’s reported figure.\n\nYear to date (YTD), CSCO shares have appreciated 17.4%, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector, as well as close peers Broadcom AVGO and Arista Networks ANET. While the broader sector has appreciated 23%, shares of Broadcom and Arista Networks have returned 51.5% and 29.7%, respectively, over the same time frame.\n\nCSCO Stock’s Performance\n\n \n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\n \n\nMeanwhile, Cisco shares are trading at a premium, as suggested by the Value Score of C. In terms of the forward 12-month price/sales, CSCO is trading at a premium of 4.57X, higher than the Zacks Computer Networks industry’s 4.33X.\n\nCSCO Stock’s Valuation\n\n \n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\n \n\nHowever, Cisco shares are trading at a discount compared with Arista Networks and Broadcom. In terms of the forward 12-month P/S, Arista Networks and Broadcom shares are trading at 17.87X and 19.75X, respectively.\n\nSo, does an expanding clientele and strong portfolio improve CSCO’s appeal to investors? Let’s find out.\n\nExpanding Portfolio to Boost Cisco’s Prospects\n\nCisco’s aggressive AI push and growing security dominance have been major growth drivers. Rapid acceleration in the capacity requirements of the network due to unprecedented levels of network traffic and an ever-evolving threat landscape bodes well for Cisco’s prospects.

China imposed export controls on a new set of rare earth materials and the methods of their processing, which may impact a variety of products and industries. More importantly, China expanded its export control framework beyond raw materials, now reaching actual products and complex devices made outside of China. This means that a product produced anywhere in the world, but containing rare earth materials from China, may be subject to Beijing's export licensing regime if the value of rare earth materials in this product exceeds 0.1%. The U.S. was quick to retaliate with a 100% tariff on China-made products and a ban on 'critical software' for China-based entities.\n\nMaterials\n\nStarting early November, China will add five heavy rare-earth elements to its export controls list, including erbium, europium, holmium, thulium, and ytterbium, as well as their alloys, oxides, compounds, and finished materials.\n\nThe controls explicitly cover magnetic powders, luminescent phosphors, fibre-optic materials, thermal-shield coatings, hydrogen storage, and magnetic alloys. These five elements and alloys on their base are used to build devices like displays, EV drivetrains, lasers, magnetic subsystems (hard drives), optical and photonic infrastructure, satellites, and more.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM TOM'S HARDWARE\nYOU MAY LIKE\nTaiwan says its chip fabs are safe from China’s rare-earth crackdown\nASML is prepared for China's rare-earth export controls\nPresident Trump warns China of massive tariff increases in wake of expanded rare earths export controls\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images / Bloomberg)\n\nThis round of China's export controls targets rare earth elements that generate, manipulate, and sense light or magnetism, which are critically important for dozens of devices and industries. By tightening export controls over these materials, China is increasing its influence over both the supply of rare earths and the foundational building blocks that the computing, defence, and telecommunication industries rely upon worldwide.\n\nWhile companies in these industries have the flexibility to switch from one supplier to another, doing so is difficult and expensive because they have downstream partners that need to validate and qualify all the components they use.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nChina's export controls policy evolved from restricting fundamental semiconductor materials such as antimony, gallium, and germanium (Round I) to advanc"
