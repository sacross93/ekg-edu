On October 15, HSBC analysts led by Frank Lee upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold, citing their expectation that the total addressable market (TAM) for AI GPUs will continue to increase beyond hyperscalers, which should result in continuous earnings growth.\n\nThe firm also lifted its price target for the stock to $320 from $200, representing an upside of nearly 78% from Tuesday’s close. Lee and his team said they had made the adjustments on the back of increasing FY27 estimates for GPU TAM compared to previous expectations, resulting in an upward revision in their data center revenue forecast for FY27 to $351 billion, which is 36% above consensus projections.\n\nThe HSBC analysts also anticipate that a potential trade deal between the United States and China could result in easing of China GPU uncertainties, which could help NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) see a demand recovery in the Chinese market.\n\nMoreover, the analysts raised their earnings forecast for Nvidia in FY27 to $8.75 per share, higher than the average street projections of $6.48. They said that this encouraging outlook was backed by surging demand across the global AI chip market.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a full-stack computing infrastructure company. It is the go-to company for firms looking for GPUs and semiconductors as they increase spending on artificial intelligence.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

The outlook hike was striking given Taiwan’s biggest company last raised its guidance just three months ago, igniting a rally that’s tacked on more than $260 billion to its market value.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAffordable Housing Left Vulnerable After Trump Fires Building Inspectors\n\nLos Angeles County Declares State of Emergency Over ICE Raids\n\nHUD Issues Layoff Notices, Targeting Fair Housing Staff With Deep Cuts\n\nWith Roles as Civic Hubs, Libraries Turn Over a New Page\n\nThere’s a Better Way to Win on Traffic Safety\n\nThe results underscore how TSMC remains one of the bigger beneficiaries of a spending spree on AI infrastructure that’s expected to cross the $1 trillion mark in coming years. From OpenAI to Oracle Corp., industry leaders are racing to build the data centers that underpin the technology in the post-ChatGPT era. TSMC’s higher projection followed a better-than-anticipated 39% jump in net income to NT$452.3 billion ($14.8 billion) in the September quarter.\n\nOn Thursday, TSMC Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei reiterated his industry was grappling with geopolitical uncertainty, and acknowledged how US sanctions have begun to close off swathes of China, the world’s largest semiconductor arena. Businesses across the global semiconductor supply chain are bracing for disruptions after Beijing imposed curbs on rare-earth mineral exports — essential to most technology devices — and the US responded with additional tariffs and restrictions on software sales to the Asian nation.\n\nBut Wei argued that AI demand would make up for that lost market. “Conviction in the AI megatrend is strengthening,” he told analysts after outlining earnings. “The AI demand actually continues to be very strong, stronger than we thought three months ago.”\n\nClick here for a blog from the earnings briefing.\n\nAs the world’s most advanced manufacturer of semiconductors, TSMC plays a dominant role in an AI investment frenzy with Nvidia at its heart. The US company makes the powerful accelerators vital to the training and operation of AI services like ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini.\n\nYet that investment rush, coupled with a rapid climb in tech stock valuations, has drawn comparisons to the dotcom bubble given the persistent absence of mainstream AI applications and services.

      "full_content": "NVDA vs. AMD: Which AI Hardware Stock Has Better Investment Potential?\nAnirudha Bhagat\nWed, October 15, 2025 at 9:35 PM GMT+9 5 min read\nIn this article:\nNVDA\nAMD\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD sit at the center of the artificial intelligence (AI) hardware revolution. Both are crucial players in the semiconductor space, competing directly in high-performance computing, graphics processing units (GPUs) and AI accelerators.\n\nWhile both companies are deeply committed to powering the next wave of AI computing, investors must be wondering which stock looks like the stronger bet right now. Let’s break down their fundamentals, growth drivers and valuations to find out.\n\nNVDA: The Undisputed AI GPU Leader\n\nNVIDIA remains the backbone of the AI boom, with its GPUs powering everything from cloud data centers to self-driving vehicles. The company continues to dominate the AI infrastructure market, driven by explosive demand from cloud providers and enterprises. In the second quarter of fiscal 2026, NVIDIA’s data center revenues surged 56% year over year to $41.1 billion, underlining the strength of its core business.\n\nThe company’s new GPU architectures, Hopper 200 and Blackwell, are rapidly gaining adoption as customers race to expand AI capabilities. The upcoming Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin platforms could further cement NVIDIA’s leadership as the AI hardware race intensifies.\n\nNVIDIA also secured U.S. government approval in August 2025 to sell its H20 chips in China under a revenue-sharing deal, where it pays 15% of Chinese H20 sales to the U.S. government. This move helps NVIDIA regain ground in China, a market that once contributed more than 20% of its revenues but has recently declined due to export restrictions. Regaining this access could stabilize a key revenue stream.\n\nFurther, NVIDIA’s expanded partnership with OpenAI, which involves the construction of massive AI data centers powered by NVIDIA systems, is expected to boost long-term demand for its GPUs. Together, these developments reinforce NVIDIA’s position as the dominant supplier of AI chips worldwide.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nNVIDIA Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | NVIDIA Corporation Quote\n\nAMD: A Capable Challenger\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices has transformed from an underdog to a strong competitor in the AI chip ecosystem.

The DGX Spark, which Nvidia said offers data center-class performance, packs the company's GB10 Grace Blackwell superchip, as well as its ConnectX-7 networking capabilities and software stack.\n\nThe idea is to provide smaller businesses and developers with access to an AI computing system without requiring them to spend thousands on renting AI data center services or buying their own AI servers.\n\nThe Spark is part of a new class of computer Nvidia is rolling out with third-party partners, including ASUS (2357.TW) and Dell (DELL), which will allow customers to develop and use AI models on their own local devices.\n\nNvidia said the Spark can be outfitted with up to 128GB of memory, which should help when running massive AI models.\n\n“In 2016, we built DGX-1 to give AI researchers their own supercomputer. I hand-delivered the first system to Elon [Musk] at a small startup called OpenAI — and from it came ChatGPT, kickstarting the AI revolution,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement.\n\n“DGX-1 launched the era of AI supercomputers and unlocked the scaling laws that drive modern AI. With DGX Spark, we return to that mission — placing an AI computer in the hands of every developer to ignite the next wave of breakthroughs.”\n\nLike the DGX-1, Huang also hand-delivered one of the first Spark systems to Musk.\n\nNvidia says its Spark desktop is the world's smallest AI supercomputer. (Image: Nvidia) · Nvidia\n\nThe company also has a larger, more powerful DGX Station, which runs on Nvidia's GB300 Grace Blackwell Ultra desktop superchip.\n\nBut don't expect to grab a Spark or Station and start running your video games or other apps. The system runs on Nvidia's own Linux-based DGX OS and its AI software stack and is specifically designed for building and running AI models.\n\nNvidia also said users can connect two Spark systems to allow for even larger AI models with up to 405 billion parameters.\n\nThe Spark and Station are designed to complement Nvidia's existing AI offerings, enabling users to prototype AI models before deploying them more widely.\n\nThe Nvidia Spark next to a desktop monitor. (Image: Nvidia) · Nvidia\n\nNvidia holds the pole position in the AI chip race thanks to both its powerful processors and CUDA software service.\n\nIn addition to its desktop systems, the company continues to ink massive deals with AI companies, including a $100 billion investment in OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) that will see the ChatGPT developer purchase 10 gigawatts of GPUs.\n\nLast month, Nvidia signed a deal that will see CoreWeave (CRWV) purchase $6.3 billion worth of GPUs from the chip giant.\n\nThe com"
