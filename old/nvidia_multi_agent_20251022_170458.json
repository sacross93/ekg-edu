On October 15, HSBC analysts led by Frank Lee upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold, citing their expectation that the total addressable market (TAM) for AI GPUs will continue to increase beyond hyperscalers, which should result in continuous earnings growth.\n\nThe firm also lifted its price target for the stock to $320 from $200, representing an upside of nearly 78% from Tuesday’s close. Lee and his team said they had made the adjustments on the back of increasing FY27 estimates for GPU TAM compared to previous expectations, resulting in an upward revision in their data center revenue forecast for FY27 to $351 billion, which is 36% above consensus projections.\n\nThe HSBC analysts also anticipate that a potential trade deal between the United States and China could result in easing of China GPU uncertainties, which could help NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) see a demand recovery in the Chinese market.\n\nMoreover, the analysts raised their earnings forecast for Nvidia in FY27 to $8.75 per share, higher than the average street projections of $6.48. They said that this encouraging outlook was backed by surging demand across the global AI chip market.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a full-stack computing infrastructure company. It is the go-to company for firms looking for GPUs and semiconductors as they increase spending on artificial intelligence.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

The GARP approach helps identify stocks priced below the market or any suitable target determined by a fundamental analysis.\n\nThe strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks with impressive prospects and trading at a discount. GARP stocks have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and other metrics.\n\nA portfolio based on the GARP strategy comprises stocks that offer the best value and growth investment. Stryker SYK, NVIDIA NVDA, ResMed RMD and Ralph Lauren RL are some promising GARP stocks.\n\nGARP Metrics: Mix of Growth & Value Metrics\n\nThe GARP strategy offers ideal investment options, utilizing the best value and growth investing features. Investors adopting the GARP approach prefer stocks priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. The stocks have solid prospects based on cash flow, revenues, EPS, etc.\n\nGrowth Metrics\n\nA strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the primary concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a tactic of GARP investors. The GARP strategy considers growth rates between 10% and 20% ideal.\n\nAnother metric considered by growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE than the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with a positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.\n\nValue Metrics\n\nGARP investing prioritizes one of the popular value metrics, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. The investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios than value investors, but it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. The price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is also taken into consideration.\n\nUsing the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.\n\nScreening Parameters\n\nAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. \n\nLast five-year EPS & projected 3-5-year EPS growth rates between 10% and 25% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)\n\nROE (in the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE than the industry average indicates superior stocks.)\n\nP/E and P/B ratios are less than the M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued.)\n\nHere are four out of the 12 stocks that made it through the screen.  Each of the four stocks carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nStryker’s inter"

The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance accelerated computing. The growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphics processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA’s Hopper and Blackwell architectures is aiding data center revenues.\n\nThe continued ramp-up of Ada RTX GPU workstations in the ProViz end market, following the normalization of channel inventory, is acting as a tailwind. Collaborations with more than 320 automakers and tier-one suppliers are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicle space.\n\nThe Zacks analyst expects NVIDIA’s revenues to witness a CAGR of 31% through fiscal 2026-2028. However, a limited supply of Blackwell GPUs may hinder its ability to meet demand. Rising costs associated with the production of more complex AI systems will hurt margins.\n\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\n"

AMD sit at the center of the artificial intelligence (AI) hardware revolution. Both are crucial players in the semiconductor space, competing directly in high-performance computing, graphics processing units (GPUs) and AI accelerators.\n\nWhile both companies are deeply committed to powering the next wave of AI computing, investors must be wondering which stock looks like the stronger bet right now. Let’s break down their fundamentals, growth drivers and valuations to find out.\n\nNVDA: The Undisputed AI GPU Leader\n\nNVIDIA remains the backbone of the AI boom, with its GPUs powering everything from cloud data centers to self-driving vehicles. The company continues to dominate the AI infrastructure market, driven by explosive demand from cloud providers and enterprises. In the second quarter of fiscal 2026, NVIDIA’s data center revenues surged 56% year over year to $41.1 billion, underlining the strength of its core business.\n\nThe company’s new GPU architectures, Hopper 200 and Blackwell, are rapidly gaining adoption as customers race to expand AI capabilities. The upcoming Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin platforms could further cement NVIDIA’s leadership as the AI hardware race intensifies.\n\nNVIDIA also secured U.S. government approval in August 2025 to sell its H20 chips in China under a revenue-sharing deal, where it pays 15% of Chinese H20 sales to the U.S. government. This move helps NVIDIA regain ground in China, a market that once contributed more than 20% of its revenues but has recently declined due to export restrictions. Regaining this access could stabilize a key revenue stream.\n\nFurther, NVIDIA’s expanded partnership with OpenAI, which involves the construction of massive AI data centers powered by NVIDIA systems, is expected to boost long-term demand for its GPUs. Together, these developments reinforce NVIDIA’s position as the dominant supplier of AI chips worldwide.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nNVIDIA Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | NVIDIA Corporation Quote\n\nAMD: A Capable Challenger\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices has transformed from an underdog to a strong competitor in the AI chip ecosystem. Its growing presence spans GPUs, CPUs, networking and AI accelerators, with major advances in both hardware and software.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices’ latest Instinct MI350X and MI355X GPUs, based on the CDNA-4 architecture, promise exceptional performance and energy efficiency. AMD’s open-source ROCm 7.0 AI software platform also supports popular models like LLaMA and DeepSeek, enhancing its competitiveness.\n\nStory Continues\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nPrivacy Dashboard"

      "full_content": "AI + ML\nDGX Spark, Nvidia’s tiniest supercomputer, tackles large models at solid speeds\n12 \nThis relatively affordable AI workstation isn’t about going fast; it’s about doing everything well enough\nTobias Mann\nTue 14 Oct 2025 // 15:00 UTC\n\nHANDS ON Nvidia bills its long-anticipated DGX Spark as the \"world's smallest AI supercomputer,\" and, at $3,000 to $4,000 (depending on config and OEM), you might be expecting the Arm-based mini-PC to outperform its less-expensive siblings.\n\nBut the machine is far from the fastest GPU in Nvidia's lineup. It's not going to beat out an RTX 5090 in large language model (LLM) inference, fine tuning, or even image generation — never mind gaming. What the DGX Spark, and the slew of GB10-based systems hitting the market tomorrow, can do is run models the 5090 or any other consumer graphics card on the market today simply can't.\n\nWhen it comes to local AI development, all the FLOPS and memory bandwidth in the world won't do you much good if you don't have enough VRAM to get the job done. Anyone who has tried machine learning workloads on consumer graphics will have run into CUDA out of memory errors on more than one occasion.\n\nThe Spark is equipped with 128 GB of memory, the most of any workstation GPU in Nvidia's portfolio. Nvidia achieves this using LPDDR5x, which, while glacial compared to the GDDR7 used by Nvidia's 50-series, means the little box of TOPS can run inference on models of up to 200 billion parameters or fine tune models of up to 70 billion parameters, both at 4-bit precision, of course.\n\nNormally, these kinds of workloads would require multiple high-end GPUs, costing tens of thousands of dollars. By trading a bit of performance and a load of bandwidth for sheer capacity, Nvidia has built a system that may not be the fastest at any one thing, but can run them all.\n\nNvidia isn't the first to build a system like this. Apple and AMD already have machines with loads of LPDDR5x and wide memory buses that have made them incredibly popular among members of the r/locallama subreddit.\n\nHowever, Nvidia is leaning on the fact that the GB10 powering the system is based on the same Blackwell architecture as the rest of its current-gen GPUs. That means it can take advantage of nearly 20 years' worth of software development built up around its CUDA runtime.\n\nSure, the ecosystem around Apple's Metal and AMD's ROCm software stacks has matured considerably over the past few years, but, when you're spending $3K-$4K on an AI mini PC, it's nice to know your existing code should work out of the box.\n\nNote that the DGX Spark will be available both from Nvidia and in custom versions from OEM partners such as Dell, Lenovo, HP, Asus, and Acer. The Nvidia Founder's Edition we reviewed has a list price of $3,999 and comes with 4TB of storage and gold cladding. Versions from other vendors may have less storage and carry a lower price.\n\nThe spark that lit the fire\n\nThe machine itself is styled like a miniaturized DGX-1, measuring ju"

A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. The equity market continued its strong performance in the third quarter of 2025, driven by enthusiasm for generative AI and strength in the semiconductor sector. In the quarter, the focus shifted to positive economic surprises, fiscal policy optimism, and better-than-expected corporate earnings. In the quarter, the strategy returned 3.34% (gross) and 3.14% (net) compared to 10.51% for the Russell 1000 Growth Index and 8.12% for the S&P 500 Index. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2025.\n\nIn its third-quarter 2025 investor letter, Polen Focus Growth Strategy highlighted stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) offers graphics, compute, and networking solutions. The one-month return of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was 7.69%, and its shares gained 43.10% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On October 13, 2025, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock closed at $188.32 per share, with a market capitalization of $4.585 trillion.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its third quarter 2025 investor letter:\n\n\"In early August we initiated positions in both NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Broadcom, after having not owned either company over the past 2½ years following the initial wave of enthusiasm around Gen AI. While we have long admired both companies, their highly cyclical business models have made it extremely difficult to forecast future earnings growth with any degree of conviction. Given our approach of seeking durable and persistent earnings growth that compounds over long holding periods, our concern in holding either was that we would be forced to endure a punishing downcycle within our typical holding period – there is very little room that in a concentrated portfolio of 20-30 companies. In fact, pre ChatGPT, NVIDIA had two punishing down cycles over the preceding five years.\n\nStory Continues\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nPrivacy Dashboard"
