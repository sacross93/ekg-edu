White\n\nTech Journalist\n\n Fact Checked by William Baxter\n\nTech Editor\n\nWhy Trust Tech Report\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nNvidia and TSMC have produced the first Blackwell wafer entirely on US soil, marking a major step toward domestic AI chip manufacturing.\nThe wafer’s production at TSMC Arizona signals progress toward reindustrialization, but full US-made Blackwell GPUs are still 1–2 years away.\nThe initiative aligns with the US CHIPS Act and reshoring efforts, aimed at securing AI hardware supply chains and reducing reliance on Asia.\nMeanwhile, Europe and the UK remain focused on research and IP through companies like ASML, NXP, and ARM, but lack comparable fabrication capacity.\n\nNvidia and TSMC have unveiled the first Blackwell wafer manufactured entirely on U.S. soil — a landmark moment for American semiconductor production.\n\nProduced at TSMC’s cutting-edge Arizona facility, the wafer marks one of the earliest concrete steps toward reshoring advanced AI chipmaking back to the United States.\n\nDuring its unveiling, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called the wafer a “historic moment” for the industry. He described it as “The vision of President Trump of reindustrialization — to bring back manufacturing to America.”\n\nThe Blackwell wafer’s debut is a strong signal that U.S. facilities are gearing up for large-scale production. Still, the journey from wafer to a fully functional GPU is long — months of intricate layering, patterning, and rigorous testing lie ahead.\n\nNvidia and TSMC’s breakthrough highlights the bigger question: how close is America to real chip independence — and what milestones must come next?\n\nFrom Wafer to Chip: How Far Away Are US-Made Blackwell GPUs?\n\nThe Arizona wafer unveiling marks only the first step in Nvidia’s U.S. chipmaking push.\n\nAt its core, a wafer is just the starting point — a thin slice of silicon that must pass through dozens of painstaking processes before it becomes a working GPU. Layering, patterning, etching, doping, and rigorous testing transform raw silicon into billions of transistors that power advanced AI chips.\n\nAt TSMC’s Arizona facility, engineers will use advanced process nodes to produce 2- to 4-nanometer wafers, as well as the upcoming A16 chips. \n\nHowever, following this stage of production, much of the final packaging and assembly – the stage where chips are cut, stacked, and connected – is still expected to take place in Asia, at facilities in Taiwan or Japan.\n\nIndustry analysts suggest that Blackwell GPUs, which are entirely made in the US, are likely at least one or two years away from large-scale deployment. Given TSMC’s $100B investment in US chip facilities in March and Nvidia’s clear intent to shift its AI server supply chain to the US, stakeholders are lik"

These 33 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10b in market cap - there's still time to get in early.\n\nNVIDIA Investment Narrative Recap\n\nTo be an NVIDIA shareholder today, you need to believe in the continued global surge in AI infrastructure spending and NVIDIA’s ability to maintain technology leadership and premium margins, despite mounting competition and geopolitical risks. The recent launch of the DGX Spark desktop AI supercomputer is an impressive technological step, but it does not appear to materially shift the near-term catalysts or risks, particularly ongoing US-China trade tension and customer vertical integration, both of which remain key uncertainties to watch. Among recent announcements, Oracle’s launch of the OCI Zettascale10, powered by NVIDIA’s AI infrastructure, stands out as highly relevant. This underlines the importance of partnerships in sustaining AI demand and scale, tying directly to near-term revenue catalysts, even as NVIDIA’s market share faces structural pressures from hyperscaler customers developing their own custom silicon. Yet despite these solid catalysts, it’s important for investors to recognize that mounting power constraints and export risks could limit NVIDIA’s long-term upside if...\n\nRead the full narrative on NVIDIA (it's free!)\n\nNVIDIA's narrative projects $337.2 billion revenue and $187.9 billion earnings by 2028.

Speaking in an interview with Citadel Securities, Huang questioned the wisdom of policies that cost America one of the world's largest markets.\n\nThe Biden Administration imposed rules in 2022 to restrict exports of Nvidia's most advanced AI chips to China. The Trump Administration blocked additional chip sales in April and later granted export licenses for certain Nvidia and AMD chips in exchange for 15% of revenues. Chinese regulators responded by telling domestic tech companies to avoid Nvidia chips designed to meet U.S. export requirements. Beijing also placed strict limits on exports of rare earths. Huang noted that about half the world's AI researchers are in China and called it a mistake not to have them build AI on American technology.\n\n←\nRelated Links\n→\nGoogle To Let 'Superfans' Test In-Development Pixel Phones\nNvidia and AMD To Pay 15% of China Chip Sale Revenues To US Government\nChina Tells Its Tech Companies To Stop Buying All of Nvidia's AI Chips\nLouvre Museum Security 'Outdated and Inadequate' at Time of Heist"
