      "full_content": "Analyst Explains Why NVIDIA (NVDA) is Investing In Its Own Customers\nFahad Saleem\nMon, October 20, 2025 at 10:17 PM GMT+9 3 min read\nIn this article:\nNVDA\n\nWe recently published 10 Trending Stocks to Watch as Brad Gerstner Explains Tailwinds for AI Trade – ’10x Manhattan Project’. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the trending stocks to watch.\n\nJames Van Geelen, the founder and portfolio manager at Citrini Research, was recently asked during a Bloomberg podcast why NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is investing in its own customers if the demand for its AI chips is real. Here is what Geelen said, focusing on the “not skeptical” view of the matter:\n\n“I could take the very skeptical view or the kind of not skeptical view. The non-skeptical view is the best thing for Nvidia is that we accomplish AGI. So anything that it can do to get us closer to that massive, massive infrastructure that’s required for that is great for them as quickly as possible. As quickly as possible. Because every year that you don’t achieve a GI becomes less likely. So that is maybe the core factor. And then there’s, it’s good for, for them and yeah, the, the and playing into that, the, because this, this isn’t necessarily like the.com bubble because the.com bubble had fiber and then it had, you know, pets.com and, and Amazon and all that stuff. This is all pretty much CapEx Right? Tech is capital intensive again, which means that it’s, it, the bust won’t necessarily be like the.com bubble where it gives the real players time to shine. If the CapEx spending grinds to a halt because the market goes down, that’s the worst thing in the world. So in a way it’s also, it’s in their interest obviously to make sure that that doesn’t happen.”\n\nAnalyst Explains Why NVIDIA (NVDA) is Investing In Its Own Customers\n\nThe current AI boom cycle stems from spending by major tech companies, and Nvidia is the biggest beneficiary of this spending. In Q2 FY2026, three direct customers accounted for 23%, 19%, and 14% of NVDA’s accounts receivable. Almost all of the company’s revenue comes from AI-related infrastructure spending. In the latest quarter, $41.3 billion of the $46.7 billion revenue came from these clients. The music could stop for Nvidia if these major companies decide to slow down their spending amid a lack of ROI. If investors sense a weakness in CapEx spending, and the market begins to waver, NVDA stock price would be the first to see its impact.\n\nBaird Chautauqua International and Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported first quarter results that were extremely solid. The company took a write-down on China-specific datacenter products and flushed out any future China contributions from their guidance, following the new export restrictions introduced in April. Demand commentary ex China was extremely encouraging—Nvidia is outgrowing expectations despite supply "

Intel may also be a factor\nTobias Mann\nThu 16 Oct 2025 // 23:25 UTC\n\nTSMC is accelerating the rollout of advanced process nodes at its Arizona fabs to meet growing demand for American-made AI products.\n\nThe Taiwanese foundry giant currently produces chips based on its older N4 (4-nanometer) process technology at its Fab 21 site in Arizona, which began volume production earlier this year, making chips for Apple and Nvidia.\n\nTSMC's next fab, the second of six planned for its Arizona manufacturing campus, will bring its N3 node to the US in 2028. Across the Pacific, TSMC is preparing to ramp production of its N2 node, but it wasn't expected to find its way into the foundry operator's US fabs until the end of the decade.\n\nNow, its plans have apparently changed. During TSMC's Q3 earnings call this week, CEO C.C. Wei revealed the company would accelerate this timeline.\n\n\"We are preparing to upgrade our technologies faster ... to more advanced process technologies in Arizona, given the strong AI-related demand from our customers,\" he said.\n\nWhether that means TSMC's second fab will skip N3 and jump straight to N2 or its yet unreleased A16 process, the exec didn't say. El Reg reached out to TSMC for clarification and we'll let you know if we hear anything back.\n\nSince first announcing its US fab expansion in 2020, TSMC has reserved its most sophisticated process technology for its Taiwanese plants. However, since announcing a $100 billion expansion of its fab footprint in an appearance alongside US President Trump early this year, the company has seen a wave of interest from American chipmakers eager to build their parts domestically.\n\nApple, Nvidia, and AMD are all producing or plan to produce parts at TSMC's first Arizona chip plant. This surge in demand has no doubt been influenced by the persistent threat of tariffs on foreign-made electronics and semiconductors.\n\nDutch government puts Nexperia on a short leash over chip security fears\nInside the belly of the beast: A technical walk through Intel's 18A production facility at Fab52\nPanther Lake sets stage for Intel's 2 nm comeback, but many details still TBD\nTrump's tariff‑shaped stick can't beat reality on US chip fabbing\n\nAnother possible factor is the imminent availability of Intel's 2-nanometer class 18A process technology, which will power the x86 giant's Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest Xeons. The success of these products could herald a shift in demand toward the rival foundry.\n\nIntel's Foundry division has been searching for a hero customer for some time, initially targeting 18A as its breakout moment. The company has since refocused on its upcoming 14A node as its first mainstream foundry offering. \n\nWhile unproven, 18A features several elements not yet available on TSMC nodes, including the use of backside power delivery, which promises to boost transistor densities by a si"

The chipmaker’s stock has enjoyed a remarkable run, fueled by surging demand for its high-powered GPUs amid the AI boom.\n\nThis wasn’t a hype-driven rally. The stock never got ahead of its fundamentals; if anything, investors were late to recognize what Nvidia had been quietly building for years. When AI’s moment arrived, Nvidia was ready to embrace it.\n\nNvidia Vs. SPY: Which Delivered Better Returns Over The Last 5 Years\n\nOver the last five years, Nvidia executed two stock splits:\n\nPROMOTED\nA 4-for-1 split on July 20, 2021\nA 10-for-1 split on June 10, 2024\n\nOn Oct. 14, 2020, Nvidia closed at $14.05 on a split-adjusted basis. That means a $1,000 investment would have bought 71 shares.\n\nAs of Oct. 14, 2025, Nvidia closed at $180.03 per share, making those 71 shares worth $12,782.13—a more than 12x return, and that’s excluding any dividends received along the way.\n\nFor comparison, a $1,000 investment in the SPY ETF, which tracks the S&P 500 index, would have grown to $1,986.69 in the same period.\n\nThe takeaway? Whether you held or missed out, Nvidia’s return has been extraordinary.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nWhat drove this exponential return?\n\nNvidia’s Key Growth Catalysts And Stock Performance In The Past 5 Years\n\nNvidia’s strategic pivot — repurposing its powerful graphics chips for AI workloads — proved transformational as AI became a dominant investment theme after OpenAI released ChatGPT in late 2022. Though AI had been evolving for decades, ChatGPT made it tangible, accessible and personal for the mainstream.. Nvidia positioned itself at the center of the AI narrative, capturing demand from cloud providers, data centers and enterprises racing to build next-generatio"
